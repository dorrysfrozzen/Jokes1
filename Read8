A foreign delegation is walking through a Soviet factory and in one of the workshops two workers are swearing violently, trying to drag a hefty pipe.
One woman from the delegation asks the translator:
- Tell me, what are these two workers talking about so emotionally?
The translator listened to the conversation of the workers and answers the woman:
- One worker says that he had sexual intercourse with this pipe.
- The second worker says that he had sexual intercourse with this pipe, with the mother of this pipe, with the head of the shop and with this plant altogether!
