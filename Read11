Two friends are calling each other. The first:
- You and your wife were visiting us yesterday and our silver spoons were missing!
The second:
- Fuck you, we didn't take anything, we don't need silver spoons!
The first:
- Yes, we found spoons, but there was still an unpleasant aftertaste in my soul.
