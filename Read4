The guy turns to his girlfriend:
- Darling, I've been wanting to tell you for a long time. We live together, why do you have a picture of some guy on your nightstand?
The girl says:
- Honey, don't be jealous, better hug me.
The guy again:
- We are almost married, we have certain plans for life with you, and here I look at this picture of some guy every day. It's infuriating!
The girl replied:
- Don't worry about this photo. This is me before the operation.
