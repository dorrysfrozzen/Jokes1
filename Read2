Two friends are talking. The first one asks:
- Do you feel ashamed to look your husband in the eye when you suck?
The second one responds:
- No, it's not. So many years together... What is there to be ashamed of?
The first one says:
- And I was ashamed yesterday. I'm fucking sucking and my husband is coming home from work!
