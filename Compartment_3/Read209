Late at night, a woman walks home through the park. Suddenly he hears:
- Stop!
She stopped. The next scream:
- Stay down!
She lay down. Further:
- Crawl!
The woman crawled. Suddenly, over his ear:
- Are you feeling ill? I'm just working with the dog, I see you were walking normally, then you fell and crawled.
