A man comes to the doctor and says:
- Doctor, it's like this, my penis turned blue...
the doctor looks at me, not understanding anything, asks:
- And how is your sex life? Regularly?
Man:
- Well, like everyone else, my wife is insatiable, we are with her seven times a day.
Doctor:
"And you're not tired?"
Man:
- So I have three more mistresses and each needs at least five times.
The doctor asks in surprise:
- And who are you fooling at work?
Man:
- Of course. My secretary is young. With her three or four times a day. So what's the matter with me, Doctor?
Doctor, wiping the sweat from his forehead:
- You are just tired of such an active life. The body reacted like that. It won't hurt to rest.
The man exhaled obliviously:
- Well, thank God. Otherwise, I sinfully thought that it was because of masturbation...
