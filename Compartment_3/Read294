American to Russian:
- I can imagine you having lunch. A thick oak table, on the table a bottle of vodka, black bread, herring, onions, porridge, dumplings. There is a machine gun under the table, a balalaika and a budenovka on the wall. There's a tank in the barn and a bear on the porch.
Russian:
- What the hell is this? Why is there only one bottle of vodka?
