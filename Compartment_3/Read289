The owner bought a young rooster, brought it home and let it into the coop. The old rooster comes up to the young one and says:
- Let's race around the barn. Whoever wins, the chickens will win.
Young:
- I agree!
They run around the barn in a race, and the owner jumps out of the house with a gun and shoots a young rooster and angrily so:
- I bought the sixth rooster and a homosexual again!
