A husband and wife are sitting in a bathhouse, suddenly a man runs in and shouts:
- What's your woman's name? I'm going to rape you now!
The wife says:
- Olya!
Guy:
- No, I won't rape you, my late mother's name was Olga! Then I'm going to rape you, what's your name?
Husband:
- Kolya, only among friends everyone calls me Olya!
