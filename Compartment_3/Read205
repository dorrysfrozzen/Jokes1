A woman in confession:
"Holy Father, I have sinned by calling a young man a son of a bitch.
Priest:
"What made you call him that, my daughter?"
Woman:
- He touched my hand without my permission.
The Holy Father touches the woman's hand:
- Like this?
Woman:
- Yes, Father.
Priest:
That's no reason to call him a son of a bitch.
Woman:
- After that, he undressed me.
A priest undressing a woman:
- Like this?
Woman:
- yes.
Priest:
That's no reason to call him a son of a bitch either.
Woman:
- And after that, he put you know what and you know where.
Priest starting to fuck a woman:
- Right?
Woman:
- Oh, yes, yes, Father!
The priest finished:
- That was no reason to call him a son of a bitch.
Woman:
"But, Father, he's got a tripper!"
Priest:
- That son of a bitch!
