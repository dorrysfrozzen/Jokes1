Two members meet. One is so cheerful, and the other is completely sluggish. They're talking. How are you and all that. The first one says:
- I don't have a life, but a raspberry! I'll work once a day and rest the rest of the time!
The second one responds:
- You feel good! I get fucked up five times a day, it's terrible, I get tired like a dog.
The first:
- Listen! Have you tried not getting up?
Second:
- I've tried, of course I haven't tried. I tried not to get up once, so they almost ate me in the end!
