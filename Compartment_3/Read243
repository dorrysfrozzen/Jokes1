Upon returning home, an elderly German couple found a burglar in their apartment. The robber turned out to be a refugee from Somalia. The God-abiding owners surrounded the criminal with warmth and care, fed him, took him to their church, gave him warm, woolen socks, read the Bible and promised to adopt him. It was only after almost two days that the robber was able to get to the phone, call the police and ask for help. After eight hours of negotiations with the police surrounding the house, the couple agreed to let the robber go. He is currently at the police station, a psychologist is working with him.
