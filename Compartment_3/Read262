A Jew from Israel decided to do business in Russia and shares ideas with a friend:
- I will sell groceries and keep a funeral company. If people live, I will earn on food, and if I die, then on coffins.
A year later, he returns, having flown out of business into the pipe and complains to a friend:
- These Russians don't live there... but they don't die either...
