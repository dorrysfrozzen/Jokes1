A student is walking through the institute, and a bearded professor is walking towards him.
- Excuse me, Professor, can I ask you a question?
Professor:
- Yes, of course.
Student:
- Tell me, when you go to bed, do you put your beard under the blanket or put it on top?
Professor:
- I don't know, somehow I didn't pay attention to it.
Student:
- Well, I'm sorry.
A week later, this professor, with bags under his eyes, meets the same student, grabs him by the breasts with shaking hands and shouts:
- Bitch! I haven't been able to sleep for a week because of you. And so and so uncomfortable!
