Vovochka came with his father to the forest. They are sitting, frying hams, talking. Vovochka, having taken a break from the meal:
- Dad, I want to shit.
Father:
- So don't be shy, we are in the forest. Shit wherever you want, you won't get anything for it!
After a while, Vovochka returns. Father:
- Well, where did you relieve yourself?
Vovochka:
- In your car.
