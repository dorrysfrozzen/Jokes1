The wife, coming home earlier than usual, found her husband with his mistress and how let's yell:
- You bastard! Is this your gratitude for everything I do for you and our children? That's it, divorce!
Her husband calms her down:
- You misunderstood everything, now I'll tell you the essence.
Wife resisting:
- Well, with all this, what other excuses can there be?
The husband begins the story:
- I was driving home after work, saw a girl voting on the side of the road, stopped. Already in the car, I saw that she was very skinny, poorly dressed and dirty.
She said she hadn't eaten anything for 3 days. I sympathized, brought her home, gave her your dinner from yesterday, untouched, because you said you wanted to lose weight.
She attacked the food very greedily, finished with it literally in 2 minutes. I asked if she wanted to wash up. While she was taking a bath, I was horrified by the sight of her clothes, worn, unwashed.
I brought her your jeans, which you haven't worn for a long time because you can't fit in them. I also found that blouse that I gave you for your birthday, which you never wore, considering that it does not suit you.
I also decided to give her the jacket my sister gave you, which you don't wear on principle. And since her worn-out shoes no longer matched the outfit in any way, so I offered her the shoes I bought in an expensive boutique that you don't wear because your secretary wears the same ones.
She was so grateful to me. Then I walked her to the door, and she asked provocatively with tears in her eyes:
- Maybe you have something else that your wife doesn't use? That's how it is!
