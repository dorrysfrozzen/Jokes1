There is a long queue for beer. The hare climbs without waiting in line. The wolf picks him up by the ears and says:
- Where are you slanting ahead of the wolf?
The hare answers:
- Wolf, let's not get hysterical, let's go quietly around the corner.
They left and after a couple of minutes the hare climbs again without waiting in line. The bear is already picking up the hare by the ears:
- Are you fucking crazy that a hare without a bear in front of him?
The hare says:
- Calm down, clubfoot, let's go around the corner.
They're gone. After a couple of minutes, the rabbit is right there without a queue. The lion grabs the hare:
- Yes, I see that you have lost your fear altogether.
And the one in response:
- Come on, let's go around the corner.
They go around the corner, and there is a Snake-Gorynych:
- Hare, well, how much can I do? All meat, yes meat! When will there be a beer?
