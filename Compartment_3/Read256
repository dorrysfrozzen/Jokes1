A man came to a restaurant, saw a very beautiful woman sitting nearby, approached her and offered:
- Do you mind if I keep you company?
Woman:
- In order for me not to mind your company, you must have a Mercedes S-class, 1 million. $in your bank account and a penis 25 centimeters long.
The man grinned:
- Of course, I do not have a representative Merc, but I have a Lamba Aventador. As for money, I'm almost a hundred Forbes, and according to the third condition, I'll say that even for the sake of such a beautiful bitch like you, I won't cut an inch off my dick.
