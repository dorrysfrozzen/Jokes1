Three friends are talking about sex. One has a doctor husband, the second is an architect, the third is a military man.
First:
- Mine sterilizes everything all the time.
The second:
- Mine is just planning and planning.
Third:
- And mine puts me in a corner and says:
- On the x% step march!
Both in chorus:
- And what?
Third:
- Che, che. If I hit it the first time, I'm lucky. And if not, I'll march until morning!
