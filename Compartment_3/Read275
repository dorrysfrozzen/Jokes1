A student came to the dining room, all the tables were occupied, sat down at the teaching table to the professor, who told him:
- Excuse me, but a goose is not a pig's companion!
Student:
- Well, okay, then I flew.
The professor was offended, remembered the student and decided to take revenge on the exam. He gives the student the most difficult ticket, and he answered everything correctly without hesitation, the professor asks another question:
- You're walking along the road and you see two bags. In one there is gold, in the other there is mind. Which one will you choose?
Student:
- With gold, of course.
Professor:
- I would have taken it wisely.
Student:
- Well, who is missing something.
The professor got angry and, without any rules, writes a GOAT in the record. The student did not look and left, but after a while he returns and says:
- Professor, you signed your name in the test, but you forgot to give an assessment!
