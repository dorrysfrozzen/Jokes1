Two friends are walking down the street. Suddenly one grabs the other's hand:
- Let's go to the alley faster!
The second:
- What happened?
The first:
- My wife is standing on the other side of the road and talking to my mistress.
The friend looked around and said:
- You've made a mistake. This is my wife talking to my mistress.
