A traffic cop goes out on the road in the morning with a hangover, his head is splitting after yesterday. Looks at the jeep looming on the horizon. Well, the money is going to the opehmelka. He stops a jeep, and a homeless man is driving. I checked the documents, everything is in order. It became interesting:
- You're a bum. Where did such a sharpener come from?
Homeless man:
- Drunk new Russians offered me, if I make them laugh, they will give me their jeep. Well, I made them laugh.
Traffic cop:
- And how did you make me laugh?
Homeless man:
- So I gave a shit on one bald man's head, his hair grew right there, everyone laughed.
The traffic cop takes off his cap, and there is a bald spot on his head. He's homeless:
- Can you give a shit about my bald head like that?
A homeless man shits on a traffic cop's bald head, and wild guffaws and screams are heard from the bushes:
- No, well, you're beautiful! Yes, I will also write off my hut to him!
