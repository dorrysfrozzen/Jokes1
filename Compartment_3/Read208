A father asks his fifteen-year-old son, who is spinning a spinner:
- Why are you doing this? What's the trick?
Son:
- It's soothing!
Father:
- You are fifteen years old, what has bothered you so much over the years? At the age of fifteen, I only cared about one thing, whether boobs would be shown in the cinema or not! And I didn't have a spinner, but I had something to spin!
