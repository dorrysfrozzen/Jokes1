The case is being heard in court. Judge:
- And so the defendant, you killed the postman with a monkey wrench.
A shout from the audience:
- That thing!
Judge:
- I ask for silence in the hall.
- After that, you killed a newspaper seller with a shovel...
a shout from the audience:
- You bitch!
Judge:
- Hush!
- After that, you hacked down a milkman with an axe...
A shout from the audience:
- Damn you, you bastard!
Judge:
- I know it's terrible, but oh, I'm calling for order in the courtroom.
A shout from the audience:
- Your Honor doesn't understand a damn thing! I lived next door to him for 30 years. When I needed a wrench, a shovel, an axe, this bastard said every time that he didn't have one!
