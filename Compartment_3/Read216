The bride and groom, who are half an hour late, run into the registry office. Both are happy, beaming with happiness. The witness asks the groom:
- Damn, where do you go? Everyone is already on their ears here. Why are you so radiant?
Groom:
- Think about it, she's done such a min%t to me now, I've never experienced anything more pleasant in my life!
The witness asks the bride:
- Where have you gone? Of course, I understand that you are happy that you are getting married, but to be so radiant with happiness ...
the bride:
- You understand, today I made the last min@t in my life!
