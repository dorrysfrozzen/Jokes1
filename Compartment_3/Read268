The student is taking the exam, and the teacher decided to wrap it up for retake. He tells the student:
- One question. If you answer it, you've passed... How many light bulbs are there in this auditorium?
Student, counting fast:
- Nine!
The teacher took a light bulb out of his pocket:
- Wrong! There are ten light bulbs. To retake!
At the retake, the same situation. The question is the same. The student responds:
- Nine.
The teacher with a smile:
- No, it's wrong, I didn't take the light bulb today.
The student pulls a light bulb out of his pocket:
- So today I took it!
