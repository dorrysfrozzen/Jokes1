Going to the cashier's window in the bank, the young guy says to the cashier:
- Hey, bitch, I want to open an account.
The cashier was shocked:
- What do you allow yourself?
That one again:
- What are you, a bitch, you don't understand! I want to open an account.
The cashier ran away and soon returned with the bank manager. The manager says to the boor:
- Show respect to my staff! What do you want?
Guy:
- I won a million dollars in the lottery, I wanted to open an account, and this bitch...
the manager turns to the cashier:
- Did you hear that bitch? Do what the dear customer tells you to do and at a pace!
