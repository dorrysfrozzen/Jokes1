Fishermen are sitting in boats, fishing. Only one of them bites. In the end, one of the fishermen can't stand it:
- What the hell is this? As if there are only fish around your boat...
he answers:
- Yes, I caught a goldfish and wished that there was always a bite on fishing.
The men are interested:
- Come on... What else did you ask the fish for?
The one:
- Well, so that the money in the wallets never runs out.
Guys:
- Well, everything is logical so far... What else did you ask for?
He
also asked that the orgasm always be with his wife at the same time.
Guys:
- Cool!
That:
- It depends on how you look at it... While fishing, I've already finished three times...
