I went out on the balcony, I look at the parsley on the newspaper. I took it and crumbled it into soup. My grandson came and asked:
- Did you take anything from the balcony?
I refused:
- Of course not, I didn't take anything.
I'm sitting here thinking about who I'm talking to, what kind of fucking grandchildren I've never had...
