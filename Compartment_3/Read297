A lonely old woman is sitting on the seashore with a broken trough, and her old cat is basking in the sun next to her. The old woman threw a seine and pulled out a goldfish. The fish begged for mercy, in return to fulfill any three wishes of the old woman. Then the old woman, with tanned eyes, was carried away:
- I want to live in bright white stone chambers.
- I want to be rich, young and beautiful.
- I want this old cat to become a young boyar and be madly in love with me.
I didn't have time to finish, as everything was fulfilled. A palace has grown up on the shore, she herself is a beautiful young girl, and next to her is a boyar of insane beauty. Well, now the beautiful girl hugged the young boyar, and he says to her:
"Now you're going to regret castrating me!"
