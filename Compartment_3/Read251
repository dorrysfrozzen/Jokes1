The blonde came to the car dealership, bought a new Jaguar, returned a week later and said:
- When I'm driving alone, I'm fine, but when I'm with someone, the car definitely stinks...
The manager examined the car, inside, outside, found nothing and offered the blonde a ride in her car together. Go. The blonde has sunk 200, overtakes, cuts off, periodically jumps out into oncoming traffic, then onto the sidewalk and in the process asks the manager:
- What, do you smell what a stink?
Manager:
- I not only feel it, I'm sitting in it...
