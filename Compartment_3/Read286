A woodcutter was chopping a tree over a river and dropped an axe into it. He began to cry with grief and then the Lord appeared to him and asked:
- Tell me, my son, why are you crying?
The woodcutter to him:
- How can I not cry, because I dropped an axe into the river and will no longer be able to earn food for my family.
Then the Lord took out a golden axe from the river and asked:
- Is that your axe?
The woodcutter is like a spirit:
- No, my God, it's not my axe.
The Lord took out a silver axe from the river and asked:
- Maybe it's your axe?
Woodcutter:
- No, and it's not my axe.
The Lord took an iron axe out of the river. The woodcutter said happily:
- Yes, he's my axe!
State to the woodcutter:
- I see that you are an honest man and keep my commandments, so take all three axes as a reward.
The woodcutter began to live in prosperity, but then his wife fell into the river. He began to cry bitterly again. And again the Lord appeared to him and asked:
- What happened again? Why are you crying?
The Woodcutter:
- And how can I not cry, my wife fell into the river.
The Lord took Jennifer Lopez out of the river and asked:
- Is this your wife?
The woodcutter:
- Yes, yes, this is my wife!
The Lord got angry:
- You lied to me. How is that? You lived according to the commandments of the Lord, didn't you?
The woodcutter explains to the almighty:
- God, if I hadn't lied, there would have been a misunderstanding. Tell me it's not my wife. Then you would have taken Catherine Zeta-Jones out of the river, and I would have said again that this was not my wife. Then you would have got my wife and I would have said that she was my only one. And you would have given me all three of them. What would I do with them? I wouldn't be able to feed them all, and all four of us would be very unhappy.
