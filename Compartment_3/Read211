Two priests are setting up a sign on the road with the inscription: "Stop, the end is near! Turn around before it's too late!" A truck passes by them at high speed and the driver swears and waves his fist:
- Fucking sectarians, got it!
The car disappears around a bend, from there you can hear a rumble and a loud splash of water. One priest says to another:
- Yes, it looks like you were right, you should have written in a simple way "The bridge is destroyed".
