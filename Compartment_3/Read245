At the disco, a guy approaches a girl:
- Excuse me, may I meet you?
Girl:
- What's that?
The guy repeated himself:
- I said, may I meet you?
Girl:
- Yes, yes, of course you can, my name is Masha.
The guy is happy to:
- Masha, may I buy you a Martini?
The girl again:
- What's that?
The guy is louder:
- Masha, can I offer you a Martini?
Girl:
- Yes, with pleasure.
We drank, danced, the guy offers:
- Masha, did you come to my place?
The girl again:
- What's that?
The guy repeats the question out of habit:
- Masha, let's go to my place, I say ...
the girl agreed. We arrived at the guy's house, had another drink, then slept together, lay in bed, then the guy decided to ask:
- Tell me, why do you keep checking?
Girl:
- What's that?
Guy:
- Fuck, I got it already... Why do you keep checking?
Girl:
- Ah. I have this form of complication after AIDS...
guy:
- What's that?
