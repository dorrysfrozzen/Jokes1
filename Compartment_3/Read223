Mom writes a letter to her son in prison:
- Son, after you were put away, I don't really know what to do... I can't do the housework, the garden has not been dug up, the potatoes have not been planted yet ...
The son writes the answer:
- Mom! Don't dig in the garden, or you'll dig up that they'll put you in jail and add another term to me!
A couple of weeks later, the son receives a letter from his mother again:
- Son, after your last letter, the police arrived, dug up the whole garden, found nothing and left dissatisfied.
The son answers:
- Mom, I helped you with what I could, you can stick the potatoes yourself!
