The Indian came to the chief and said:
- I want to get married.
The chief to him:
- Yes, where do you want to get married, you don't know what to do with your wife! Hold a log with a hollow, go study.
After the wedding, the Indian brought his wife to his wigwam, she undressed and lay down. The Indian started hitting her ass with terrible force. The wife screams:
- What are you doing?
Indian:
- Shut up. I know everything. First, I'll drive the bees out of the hollow...
