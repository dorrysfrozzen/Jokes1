The guy came with a box for the entrance exam to the food institute. The admissions committee got tired of applicants after a five-hour exam, and there's another strange one with a shoe box. Commission to him:
- Well, tell me, what brought you to us? Have you dreamed of becoming a cook since childhood?
Guy:
- It's not about that at all. As a child, I was very interested in Russian folk tales. I entered the Faculty of Philology.
Commission:
- Well, why come here, what are the fates?
The guy continues:
- I was very interested in biology at school. I transferred to the biofac.
The admissions committee doesn't understand anything:
- Well done, of course, but what does our institute have to do with it?
Guy:
- I'm asking for help.
The guy pours the contents of the box onto the table, a dozen small huts on chicken legs run all over the table. Guy:
- You can imagine! They haven't eaten anything for the fifth day...
