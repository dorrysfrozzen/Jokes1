A lady in a chic coat enters the compartment of the train where the nun is traveling. Nun:
- My God! How much does this charm cost?
Lady:
- Night of love!
The lady takes off her coat, and under it a necklace. Nun:
- My God! And how much does such a charm cost?
Lady:
- Two nights of love!
The lady takes off her gloves, and on her finger is an emerald ring. The nun again:
- My God! And how much does the ring cost?
Lady:
- Three nights of love!
The nun returned to her monastery. Night. The cell. There's a knock on the door. Nun:
"Who's there at this hour?"
From behind the door:
- It's me, Father Andre.
The nun:
- Oh, you should go Father Andre, with your caramels!
