The minister decided to take a walk in the park after a hard day's work. A pretty girl approaches him and offers:
- Come with me. Not expensive, $20 in total.
The minister estimated:
- The girl is not very bad-looking, $ 20 is generally tfu, a small change.
- Come on!
The Minister had a very excellent time with her. Thanked him and asked:
- How do you live with such earnings? Pennies! And life in the capital is not cheap.
Girl:
- Life is certainly not sugar, I barely make ends meet, but when the money runs out completely, I turn to another craft ...
- To blackmail!
