Two friends are talking. The first one asks:
- Svetka, have you already decided what you will wear to meet your sailor from a long voyage?
The second one responds:
- Yes, I wanted to wear his favorite dress, but the stain does not appear on it in any way, I have tried everything!
The first one teaches:
- Listen, girlfriend, a man has been sailing the seas for three years... You put on something that's not a pity...
