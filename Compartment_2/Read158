A guy is sitting in a bar and drinking. A passing nun looked at the man with a reproachful look and said to him:
- How can you waste your life in this place of drunkenness and debauchery...
Man:
- I'm just having a drink. What's wrong with that? There is no debauchery here.
Nun:
- This is not acceptable with our Lord!
Guy:
- What's your sister's name?
Nun:
- Call me Anna.
Guy:
- Sister Anna, have you ever tried to drink yourself?
Nun:
- Of course not! It's so disgusting!
Guy:
"How can you say that if you've never tried it?" Let me buy you a drink and you try it!
Nun:
- You're welcome! How will people look at me?
Guy:
- I'll ask the bartender to pour it into an ordinary cup for you.
The nun hesitated a little, but eventually agreed. A man comes up to the bartender and says:
- Two hundred vodka each, but pour one hundred into an ordinary cup.
The bartender looked at the man:
- Sister Anna?
