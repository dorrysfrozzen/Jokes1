A very old, rich grandfather married a young woman. A year later, the grandfather brought the young woman to the hospital to give birth. The doctor was very surprised:
- Well, you give it!
The grandfather proudly replied:
- The engine must always be kept working!
A year later, he brings this wife back to give birth. The doctor never ceases to be surprised:
- Well, grandfather, you are strong, however!
Grandfather answered proudly again:
- The engine must always be kept working!
A year later, my wife gives birth again. The doctor comes out of the operating room and tells his grandfather:
- Grandfather, it's time to change the oil in the engine! Black was born!
