Lieutenant Rzhevsky comes to the tavern to his Hussar friends. Everyone can see that their friend is not cheerful. They ask what happened. That's what he says:
- Can you imagine, gentlemen, what the current youth is like?.. Yesterday I was walking through the village and I saw... there is a girl of about 13 years old and plaintively says so to me
- Uncle, let's fuck me and give me three rubles for it. just for my bread.
- I felt uneasy and so sorry for her...
the Hussars ask:
- What did you do, Rzhevsky?
Rzhevsky answers:
- Fuck@l and cried, fuck@l and cried...
