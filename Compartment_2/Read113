A man is walking in the park. One attraction has a lot of people. I got interested, bought a ticket, got in line, it's worth it. It's almost his turn and the man in front of him bends his head and sticks it into the hole in the wall of the house, then with a sharp movement sticks it out and runs behind the house. Well, the man became even more interesting. He comes up, sticks his head in and someone kicks him in the head like %bet! Guy:
- Well, I'm going to find out who hit you, I'm going to hit you.
He runs around the house and sees that there is nothing on the other side, only a wall and a hole in it, and someone's head is sticking out of the hole...
