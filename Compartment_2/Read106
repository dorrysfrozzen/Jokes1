Two Jews meet. Sema:
- Moisha, what do I see? Do you read anti-Semitic literature?
Moisha:
- Still yes!
Sema:
- But how can you?
Moisha:
â€“ Oh, Sema! I read our Jewish literature. I will tell you this haloimes. They killed, tortured, slaughtered, and staged a Holocaust. It's sickening! And I read anti-Semitic literature, it turns out that we rule the world, we put everyone in important positions, we bought everyone. It's a solid positive!
