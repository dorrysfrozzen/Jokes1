The buyer bought everything in the hypermarket for almost a million, goes to the checkout, pays and the girl to this man at the checkout as usual:
- Thank you for the purchase.
The buyer indignantly:
- Thank you and nothing else? Yes, for clients like me, you have to suck x%!
The girl at the checkout:
- I'm sorry, but according to the rules, we have self-service!
