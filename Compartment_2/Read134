Stirlitz was walking down the corridor. February 23rd was approaching, and there was nothing to drink. He went into Muller's office and said:
Mr. Gruppenfuhrer! Lend me 100 Reichsmarks by mid-April.
Muller gave Stirlitz money. Stirlitz walked down the corridor and thought:
- Only the last phrase is well remembered.
Stirlitz returned to Mueller's office:
- Mr. Gruppenfuhrer, lend me another 50 pfennings!
