Talking to friends on the phone. The first one:
- Kapets is bashing me today. I don't remember leaving you yesterday! The last bottle was definitely superfluous.
Second:
- Definitely the last one was superfluous! By the way, come to my place today.
The first one:
What the hell?
Second:
- What the hell? You will take your hat, and at the same time you will return my cat!
