The grandson comes home from school and tells his grandmother:
- Grandma, we studied the genitals in class today!
Grandma heard this and immediately ran to his mother:
- Can you imagine what your son is studying in class? The genitals!
The mother answers:
- Of course I know, it's in all schools in the school curriculum.
Grandma comes into her granddaughter's room to invite her to the table, and at this time he is crying. Grandma, resigned to everything, says:
- First you need to have lunch, and only then do your homework!
