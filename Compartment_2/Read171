There are two fleas, one fat and one thin. Thick:
- hello. Where are you now?
Skinny:
- In the biker's beard.
Thick:
- It's understandable why you're so skinny. And I live under the skirt of a beauty. I recommend it!
The thin one jumped under the girl's skirt a couple of days later, settled down, relaxed, and took a nap... He wakes up in a biker's beard.
