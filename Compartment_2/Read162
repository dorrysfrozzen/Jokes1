A distraught Givi is sitting at the entrance of the building of the Union of Artists of the Georgian SSR. He is being asked :
- Givi, why are you so sad?
- Wah, I painted a picture for five years, it's called "Life". And the khudsovet did not approve, eh!
They're asking again:
- Givi, why? You're not some kind of abstract artist, you've always written TV in the style of social realism. What's wrong this time?
Givi:
- Wah slyushai, I painted a picture for five years. A big naked woman is lying on the bed and a baby is sucking her breasts next to her. "Zhyzn" is called. And the artistic council did not approve! Five years, five years...
They clarify with Givi:
- What did the Khudsovet say?
Givi:
- They said to shave the child and put him in underpants!
