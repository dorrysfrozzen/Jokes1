In the Far North, on the road, a man's car broke down. It's freezing outside under 50, he's standing on the highway and hitching a ride. He stops the car, there's a girl in it. Man to her:
- Give me a lift to the city, the car was covered with a copper basin, I was sick of standing in the cold for an hour...
