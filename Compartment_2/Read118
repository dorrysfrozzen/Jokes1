A man goes home after work. he walks into his yard and sees complete devastation in the yard. The asphalt is all broken, the trees are down by the roots, there is a pit in place of the sandbox. The guy thought he was mistaken about the yard. He looks at this armageddon and sees a five-year-old neighbor's girl all covered in dirt in a torn sundress, her breath is knocked out. The man to her:
- What happened to you?
The girl opened her eyes slightly and, barely waving a shovel, whispers tiredly:
- Phew, I've played enough!
