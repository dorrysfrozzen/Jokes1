The daughter and father come from the crematorium and carry the ashes of the deceased mother-in-law in an urn. My daughter says:
- Dad, let's put this urn on the piano, and when I play, she will be pleased, during her lifetime she loved to listen to me ...
Father:
- No, daughter. We'll put her to sleep in an hourglass, let her work some more!
