A very well-known and rather cool foreign company has released a new type of safe with a lifetime warranty and announced a competition to test it and advertise it. Whoever can get $1 million out of this safe, with the lights off in three minutes, becomes the owner of this money. The Americans came out to torture their fate. The lights went out, they fumbled around the safe, but all to no avail. Not fate. The Germans advanced a little further. Only the first lock was opened, time was up. The lights go out and the Russian men have started working. The time is over. Representatives of the company turn on the light, but the light does not light up. They're trying to turn it on again... It's dark! And in this pitch darkness, a voice is heard:
- Tolyan ept, what the hell do you need light bulbs for? We have a whole lemon green in our pocket!
