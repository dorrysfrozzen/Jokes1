The woman is undergoing a medical examination. The doctor tells her:
- In general, everything is fine with you, but I would recommend that you step up your sex life. Ideally, it's three times a week.
Woman:
- Well, I'm all for it! But tell my husband, he just brought me and is sitting in the hallway right now.
My husband was called and the doctor tells him:
- I have come to the conclusion that for the best health of your wife, sexual intercourse is necessary, at least three times a week.
The husband is unperturbed:
- On what specific days?
The DOCTOR:
- Well, I don't know, say, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.
Husband:
- Saturday - not right away!
Doctor:
- Why not Saturday?
Husband:
- There are a lot of people coming to you on Saturdays! You'll spend half the weekend here!
