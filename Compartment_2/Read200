The first day of the school year and the new teacher gets to know the children:
- Children, tell us who your parents are and how you live.
Masha:
- I have a mom and I live very well.
Sasha:
- And my dad is a traffic cop, I also live well.
Vovochka:
- My dad is a trucker. And if it weren't for my parents like Masha and Sasha, I would have lived well!
