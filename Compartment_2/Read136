A man and his wife came to the doctor with a problem:
- Doctor, my wife is not worth it!
Doctor:
- Invite your wife.
The husband went out into the corridor and sent his wife to the office. Doctor to her:
- Undress completely. Yeah, turn around, bend over. Lie down on the couch. Spread your legs. So yeah. Now lie down on your stomach. Now get on all fours. So, everyone get dressed and invite your husband.
The wife went out, the husband came in a minute later and the doctor told him:
- Don't worry. You're all right. I didn't get up on your wife either!
