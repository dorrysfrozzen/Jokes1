A rich man approaches the mirror, looks at himself and thinks out loud:
- Well, I have a muzzle. Ears like locators, eyes small like a rat's, nose like a plum. There is almost no hair left, the skin is all wrinkled. And the belly... It's like swallowing a big samovar. Legs in general, it's scary to look at... short, crooked.
He turned his head and made a conclusion looking at a long-legged, young girl sleeping:
- Fuck, that's how you have to love money...
