The girl asks:
- Are you an oilman?
The man replied:
- No, what kind of oilman is there ...
the girl refused to take and left. A man changes his mind in the cold, after a while stops another car, asks for a ride to the city, and in the car the girl also asks:
- Are you an oilman?
The man is banging his teeth:
- Yes, what's bothering you, I'm not an oilman...
And this girl refused to give me a ride and also left. It's getting dark on the highway, the frost is getting stronger, the man is already frozen through. He stops the third car, begs for a ride. Again the girl and again the question:
- And you are an oilman.
The man is already ready to become anyone, just to get to the warmth and get to the city. He answers the girl.
- Of course I'm an oilman!
The girl picked up the man, they go and the girl asks:
- Can we turn up the speed of the stove to warm up faster?
Guy:
- It wouldn't be bad!
The girl again:
- There's a flask of cognac in the glove compartment. Would you like 50 grams from the cold?
Man:
- I won't refuse, I won't refuse...
The man rolled a fifty kopeck piece of cognac, the stove in the car is bursting with heat, relaxed, and the girl asks him:
- Maybe I'll give you a light min%tick
The man is already completely relaxed:
- Yes, yes of course!
They drive up to the city and the girl is interested:
- Have you been working as an oilman for a long time?
The man answers:
- Well, a little more than half an hour, but I already really like this profession!
