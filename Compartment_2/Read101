The notary announced the will and the widow, to her surprise, finds out that her late husband left part of the inheritance to his young secretary. Angry as hell, she comes to the funeral home to the master, whom she ordered a slab for her husband's grave, and says:
- I definitely need to change the inscription on the tombstone.
The master was puzzled:
- You see, it is impossible to change the engraved inscription, if only something is added, there is still room there.
After a little thought, the widow says:
- That's it. To the phrase "sleep well" add, "before we meet again."
