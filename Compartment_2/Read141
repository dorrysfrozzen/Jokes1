A resident of New York, Ms. Kogan, came to the tour agency and says:
- I need to go to India!
The manager of the tour agency is interested in:
- Tell me, why India? It's a long flight, it's very dirty, the heat is unbearable, the transport system is at a backward level, with products of complexity, you can't drink water, to all this, cholera, plague, hepatitis... More than one Jewish doctor.
But Ms. Kogan refused to be persuaded and ended up in India. Three days after my stay, I barely made it to the main temple alive and got in line for an audience with the most important Guru. I stood in line for two more days. Before entering the temple, the maid warned that she could make a request to the holy Guru with only three words. She went up to the platform where the Guru was sitting, but did not kneel down like everyone else, but stood exactly opposite the Guru, folded her arms on her chest, fixed her gaze directly into his eyes and said:
- Abrasha, come home already!
