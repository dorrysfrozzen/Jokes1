A man comes to work sleepy and rumpled. His partner asks him:
- What is it?
The man says:
- I had too much yesterday, I came home after midnight, my wife wouldn't let me in the door, I had to spend the night on the street.
A partner teaches:
- And next time you take off your clothes in front of the door, as soon as your wife opens the door, throw your clothes inside. He won't drive away the naked one!
The next day, the man came again without mood, again did not get enough sleep. He tells his partner:
- Yesterday I did as you advised. I quickly undressed in front of the door, the door opened, I threw my clothes into the apartment...
My partner:
- And what about the wife?
The man:
- And she said in a mechanical voice that the next station was Taganskaya and slammed the doors!
