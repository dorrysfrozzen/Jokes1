- Mom, what are the advantages of men?
Mother to her:
- I'll say that to my daughter. Male advantages, there are three types
- When a man is 20 years old, his cock is like an oak tree. Strong and solid.
- When a man is between thirty and forty, he bends like a birch tree, but is generally reliable.
- When a man is over fifty, his dignity is like a Christmas tree.
The daughter asks again:
- How's the Christmas tree?
The mother explains:
- Yes. And the roots are dead and the balls are just for decoration.
