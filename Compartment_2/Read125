Two residents from the metropolis stopped in a small village and went to a local drinking establishment. After a while, a local guy came in, the same local rural type, with a tape recorder and an attempt to sell it. The first resident of a large city says to another:
- Look, look, and his iphone is very real! Now we will squeeze it out almost for free!
They called a guy over and asked him how much he wanted for a tape recorder. Guy:
- 700 rubles and it's yours!
City to him:
- Yes, it's boring for you. Sit down with us, have a drink, have something to eat.
The man joined the company with pleasure. After a couple of rooms, the townspeople told him:
- You understand, 700 rubles is very, very expensive for a beushny mafia.
The man was a little crumpled:
- God be with you, give us 500 rubles and it's yours!
The townspeople do not stop haggling:
- No, no. It's still expensive. Let's roll 200 more.
A man without hesitation:
- Come on. 200 at a time, so 200 at a time.
As a result, after each drink, the man discounted the price and when the townspeople were ready to buy a tape recorder for 50 rubles, the local man waved another glass and said:
- Thank you, kind people! Watered, fed! I had such a terrible hangover in the morning and I didn't have a penny to buy a drink. If you hadn't really had to sell the tape recorder to get drunk!
