Three Armenians are walking down the street, in front of them is a beautiful girl.
One Armenian:
- Eh, to sleep with a girl like that, I wouldn't spare ten thousand!
The second Armenian:
- What's ten, I don't mind twenty!
The third Armenian:
- What are you, such a beauty, such a beauty! Such a girl should be dressed, shod, given an expensive car, taken to a restaurant every evening!
The girl turns around:
- I'm sorry, which of you was the last to speak?
The third Armenian:
- Girl, you go, we're just talking to each otherâ€¦
