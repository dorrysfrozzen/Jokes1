A vacationer, a young girl, swimming in the hotel pool, lost her swimming trunks. Grabbing the first sign that fell, covering her front charms, avoiding the gaze, she hurried to the hotel. But the man who came across laughed very hard. The girl objected:
- Just don't make fun of me!
Passing by the mirror, she stopped and smiled broadly at herself after reading the inscription on the sign:
- Only for adults! The depth is from 2 to 8 meters!
