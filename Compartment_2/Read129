My grandfather comes to a famous and rich doctor and says:
- Doctor, I've been crazy about women all my life. Blondes, brunettes, brown-haired, thin, fat, slender, all sorts!
Doctor:
- I get it, I get it. But sexually transmitted diseases, this is not my profile!
Grandfather:
- Doctor, you don't understand me. I loved them, as it were, to make it clearer... in different places. The priority was in expensive cars. Sports cars, executive limousines. I have registered women in almost all expensive brands!
The DOCTOR:
- And so that's the thing. Let me guess. Do you have osteoarthritis or sciatica?
Grandfather:
- Not at all.
- Can you borrow your Ferrari until tonight?
