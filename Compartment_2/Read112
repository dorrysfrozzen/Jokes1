An American tourist in Moscow really wants to write. There are no forces to endure anymore. He came up to some house, just unbuttoning his fly, a policeman called out to him:
- What are you going to do here?
The American responds:
- I really want to write!
The policeman:
- You can't come here, follow me.
He leads him through some well-kept park, leads him to a tall cream-colored house. He tells the American:
- Here, pee here.
The American unbuttoned his fly, did his job, turns around and asks happily:
- Oh, yes, it's wonderful! Tell me, is this what Russian hospitality eats?
The policeman:
- no. This is the American Embassy.
