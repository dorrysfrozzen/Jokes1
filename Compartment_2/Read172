The teacher at the school conducts a survey of children, who they will be when they graduate, grow up. The children are shouting:
- Engineer, accountant, lawyer.
Vovochka says:
- A sex therapist.
The teacher:
- Vovochka, do you have any idea about what sex therapists do?
Vovochka:
- Of course, I can imagine. Like all doctors, treatment. For example, two women are walking down the street, both holding ice cream in their hands. One bites her ice cream, the other licks. Which one of them is married?
The teacher:
- I think it's the one that bites.
To which Vovochka explains:
- No, it's wrong. The one with the ring on her ring finger is married. I will treat people like you!
