The husband came home drunk and his wife started yelling at him from the doorway that except for vodka, well, no interests. Then the husband reaches into his pocket, takes out a piece of paper and says:
- I brought the test, let's see what you are like with our interests!
- The first question. Tell me the two names of the foreign currency?
Wife:
- Well, for example, the dollar and the euro.
Husband:
- The second question. Two names for contraceptives.
Wife:
- Yes, at least ten, at least the name, at least the type!
Husband:
- All right. The third question. Is there a large river in Albania? That's it! You don't know!
- Except for money and sex, well, no interests!
