Donald Rumsfeld and Colleen Powell are sitting in a bar, drinking and planning a major operation in the East. A guy came up to them out of interest and asked:
- Are you really Donald Rumsfeld? Are you really Colleen Powell?
They replied:
- Yes, it really is us.
Guy:
- I wonder what you are discussing now?
Powell says:
- We plan to kill 10 million Afghans and one locksmith.
The guy is very surprised:
- And the locksmith for what? Maybe let him live?
Powell turns to Rumsfeld and says:
- You see, Donald, I was right! Nobody gives a shit about these 10 million Afghans!
