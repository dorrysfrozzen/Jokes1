A guy is sitting in a bar and drinking. A pretty young girl is sitting at the table opposite. The guy looked at his watch, then at the girl, then back at his watch. The girl noticed this and asked, interested:
- Tell me, why are you looking at me, then at the clock, then at me, then at the clock?
Guy:
- You see, girl, it's not an easy watch, they can predict a lot.
The girl is even more interested:
- And, for example, what?
Guy:
- For example, what are you wearing under your outerwear right now...
a girl with a smile:
- Oh, how interesting and what am I wearing?
Guy:
- I will not name the exact manufacturer of underwear, but the clock shows that you are now without panties.
Girl:
- Yes, what are you saying... But it's not. I'm in my panties right now! So that the clock is not showing you correctly!
The guy looked at his watch again with an intelligent look and replied:
- Yes, everything is shown correctly! Well, maybe they're in a bit of a hurry...
