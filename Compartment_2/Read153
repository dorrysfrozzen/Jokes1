A man comes out of the bathhouse with a can of beer and imagines drinking a cold beer at home. There is a bottle lying on the road, the man intuitively kicks it, the bottle breaks, a genie appears from the bottle and offers gratitude to the man for his release. The man commands:
- I want this canister to never run out of beer.
The genie conjured and disappeared.
And that guy still can't open that canister.
