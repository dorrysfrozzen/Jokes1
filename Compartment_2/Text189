Two friends found a very ancient jug on the beach. When they began to clean it, an ancient, gray-bearded genie flew out of it and said:
- Oh, the most worthy of the worthy! You have freed me from the imprisonment of this jug and for this I will fulfill any of your wishes!
The girls are embarrassed and say:
- Yes, what is there! Fuck us and that's it, otherwise no one can satisfy our needs.
Jin bowed:
"Oh, young, sun-like creatures, I obey and obey! Fuck-toh-tibidoh-tibidoh.
Here the girls interrupt him:
- No, not Grandfather! You give us away like a man, so that we don't immediately regain consciousness after that.
The genie is guilty:
- Oh, woe to me and shame on my gray hair! Spare me, I've been impotent for five hundred years.
Girls:
- Grandfather, it's good to tell us about impotence here, pull a hair out of your beard, conjure it and it will stand like a young man!
Gin:
"Oh, light of my eyes, I would love to. But for all the bl@days like you, no beard is enough!
