In high water on a small piece of land, a dog and a Hare escape from disaster. The water is coming and coming every minute, there is just a little bit left and the island will go under water. A boat appeared in the distance. The hare cried out in joy:
- We are saved! I know this boat. This is Grandfather Mazai.
The dog looked, looked and looked closer at the boat and said:
- Yes, it's not a hare, it's too early to rejoice! This is not a dirty boat... It's Gerasim!
