He worked at the bank as a very executive programmer. I did everything as it was written in the job description. One day he disappeared. He hasn't been at work for two days. The director of the bank found out and ordered to raise everyone's ears so that they would be found in two hours. Let's go to the programmer's house. They don't open the door to answer the bells, but you can hear the splash of water outside the door. They put up the door, they enter the apartment, and the programmer is sitting in the bathroom in a very exhausted state, all loose from water, almost bald on his head, a bottle of shampoo in his hand. They snatched the bottle from him, and the instructions on the bottle:
- Wet your head, squeeze out a small amount of shampoo on your hand, rub the shampoo through your hair, rinse with water.
- Repeat.
