A Russian and an American are talking about cars.
American:
- When I'm in a good mood, I prefer a light-colored car! If I have a lot of things to do and a lot of problems, then I get behind the wheel of a dark car! When I'm on vacation abroad, I choose cars in bright, festive colors!
Russian:
- Everything is much simpler here! The mood is too good, you can take a ride in a yellow car with a blue stripe. If you feel somehow unimportant, then the car will be white, and the stripe will be red. I've only traveled abroad once.
- On the tank!
