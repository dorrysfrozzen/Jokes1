The woman came to the doctor:
- Doctor, I'm not feeling well at all, I don't sleep, I don't have an appetite.
The doctor recommends:
- Find yourself a lover.
A week later, the woman comes back:
- Doctor, your advice does not help, I still feel unwell.
The doctor advises again:
- Meet two lovers.
A couple of weeks later, the woman is back at the doctor. The doctor is already wondering:
- What did not help in this case?
The woman says:
"That's not the point, Doctor. I just need a certificate for my husband that I'm not fucking, but undergoing treatment.
