My wife woke up early, went to the kitchen to cook breakfast. Farted and grinned:
- Oh, January.
Then he cooks. Farted again:
- Op, February.
Giggles and farts:
- March, April, May, June...
At one point he turns and sees his father-in-law sitting at the table. She:
- Oh, Dad... Good morning! How long have you been here?
Father-in-law:
- Since February, ept!
