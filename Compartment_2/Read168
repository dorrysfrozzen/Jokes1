A man comes into the bar, with an ostrich and a wet cat. They sit down. A waiter approaches them to take their order. The man orders a beer, turns to his companions and asks:
- Do you need to order something?
Ostrich:
- I think I'll have a beer too.
Cat:
- And I have beer too.
The waiter brought the order and said:
- You will be charged 7.65 per order
The man reached into his pocket, pulled out the named amount without looking, the waiter checked, everything was exactly 7.65. The next evening, the picture repeats, again without looking and again exactly on the bill. Once again, when a man with his companions came to the bar, the waiter, out of curiosity, decided to ask the man how he could get the right amount of money.This company comes and orders a double whiskey.
- Listen, the fact that you go to the bar with animals is purely your business, as they say, who likes what, but how do you manage to get an even amount out of your pocket without counting?
Well, the guy tells me:
- Not so long ago, I inherited a house in the attic of which I found a lamp, and there was a genie in it. My first wish was that I always had as much money in my pocket as I needed. It doesn't matter if I buy a pack of cigarettes or a car.
Waiter:
- Well, this is really a wise decision!
Waiter:
- Well, and the second and third wish, what is it?
Man:
- I got a little overreacted here. I asked Jin to always have a chick with long legs and a wet pussy with me...
