Kolyan and Tolyan were at the same cool banquet, at the end of which a charity lottery began. After buying tickets for $100, Kolyan won a tube of toothpaste, and Tolyan a toilet brush. A couple of days later, Tolyan calls Kolyan and says:
- Well, how do you like the toothpaste, buddy?
Kolyan answers:
- Yes, awesome toothpaste, it's so nice! How do you like the toilet brush?
Vovan:
- Yes, it's tin! Toilet paper, a hundred times better!
