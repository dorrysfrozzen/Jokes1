A guy comes to the bar and tells the owner:
- I'll tell you that I'm a great pianist. I played in a very advanced club and everyone liked it! Take me to work. I'm going to play my own pieces, you won't hear them anywhere else. The owner of the bar says:
- Come on, play something...
Guy:
- Listen up. This thing is called "I'm going to fuck you in the ass."
The owner did not have time to open his mouth, as the guy ran off the coolest rock and roll.
Owner:
- Go on!
The guy drinks a mug of beer and again surprises the owner with a light tango called "Suck until I cum."
The owner takes the guy to work, but asks that before the performances, he does not announce the names of his songs. That same evening, the whole bar was buzzing with the songs of the new musician. A huge success. After another beer, the guy went to the toilet, relieved himself, but forgot to fasten his fly. He walks down the hall and the bartender says to him:
- Do you know?
The guy asks:
- what?
Bartender:
- Your x% is sticking out!
The guy proudly replied to him:
- I know Kanesh! I wrote it!
