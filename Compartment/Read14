A man has recovered in a public toilet, and a handless man is trying to relieve himself at a nearby urinal. The armless one turns to the man:
- Be a friend, unbutton your fly.
The man answers:
- Well, since that's the case, let's unbutton it.
He unbuttoned his fly, and the armless man's penis was covered in acne, pimples and ulcers.
The armless one asks again:
- Can you help me, guide me?
The man fastidiously took hold of the armless man's penis with two fingers and helps him relieve himself.
They relieved the need of the armless one, who asks the man:
- Now fill it up, please.
The man tucked in, zipped up the poor guy's fly and asked out of curiosity:
- What's wrong with your dick?
The armless man takes his hands out from under his clothes and says,
"Who knows? But just in case, I don't touch him with my hands!
