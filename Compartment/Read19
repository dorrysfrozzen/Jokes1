A cowboy is riding, and the annoying smell of shit is in the air. An Indian is walking along the road. The cowboy stopped and asked the Indian:
- Why does it smell like shit, it's probably been two miles?
The Indian begins the story:
- A long time ago, many millions of years ago, when only dinosaurs lived here...
After an hour of the story, the Indian continues:
- Our ancestors settled here, abandoning the eastern lands...
After two hours of the story, the Indian does not stop:
"Well, one of our tribes lives in that dried-up canyon.
He pulls his hand away to the other side:
"But our other tribe lives in that canyon.
- The son of the chief of one tribe, fell in love with the daughter of the chief of another tribe. But the chiefs were against them meeting. They climbed up on that high rock and, as a sign of their love and disagreement with their fathers, they jumped into the abyss hand in hand.
The cowboy listened, listened, couldn't hold back and asked:
- In short... Why does it smell like shit?
The Indian replies,
"How do I know?"
- Probably someone took a shit?
