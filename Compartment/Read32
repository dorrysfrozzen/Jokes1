The hunter had not been hunting for three years, so he decided to go. He walks through the forest, sees an elk drinking water from a stream. The hunter took aim and fired from fifty meters away. The moose did not react in any way. The hunter came up and shot at the moose from thirty meters away. Moose has zero emotions again. A man shoots at a moose from ten meters away, and a moose is at least something. Hunter's Thoughts:
- I haven't been hunting for three years, I completely forgot how to shoot, I can't get into a large animal from ten meters away.
Moose's Thoughts:
- Damn, what a hangover... I'm drinking water, but I'm getting worse and worse...
