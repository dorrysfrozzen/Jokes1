A serious authority in politics and the criminal world has died. He approaches the gate to Paradise, St. Peter looks through the lists and does not find him there. The authority was seriously outraged:
- I have built so many temples! How many monasteries have I helped to restore! This can't be happening, look carefully!
Saint Peter looks through the lists again and again does not find it. Embarrassed, he says:
- Wait, I'll go to Myself now, I'll consult!
Two hours later, Saint Peter appears with Himself. The Lord, lowering his eyes, says:
- It was a serious decision and it was very difficult for us...
- We decided to return the money to you!
