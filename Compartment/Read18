"Mers" and "Zaporozhets" stopped at the traffic light in parallel. The driver of the Zaporozhets knocks on the glass of the Mersa:
- Hey, do you have any fax paper? I'm out of it, but I need to take a message...
the owner of the "Merc" comes to the dealership and yells at the managers:
- I said that the complete set of the car should be in full! Where's the fax machine?
The next day, the owner took his "Merc" already with a fax and meets with the same "Zaporozhets" and knocks on his window:
- Man, do you still need fax paper?
After a while, the owner of the Zaporozhets leans out of the window and says:
- What did you want?
The owner of the "Merc" to him:
- I said, do you still need fax paper?
The owner of the "Zaporozhets" in response:
- I don't need it anymore. And you pulled me out of the hot tub because of this stuff?
