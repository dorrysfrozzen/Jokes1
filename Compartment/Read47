Two ladies are playing golf. One hits the ball and sees it hit a man from a company playing nearby. The man grabs his crotch with his hands and starts rolling on the ground with a groan. The lady runs up to him:
- Excuse me, please, I didn't mean to!
The man says:
- Yes, there is nothing, it will pass soon!
Lady:
- I'm a doctor, let me help you!
Man:
- There's nothing to worry about, calm down already.
The lady does not calm down. She unbuttons the man's fly, runs her hand inside and begins to massage. After finishing the massage, he sprays:
- Is it better?
The man answers:
- Yes, it was great, but my arm still hurts.
