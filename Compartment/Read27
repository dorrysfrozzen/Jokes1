A Russian couple comes to a resort abroad. We settled down in the room, suddenly the wife screams:
- Mouse! Ahh! Call the reception, explain the situation to them, you know at least something, somehow in English, and I'm zero at all!
The husband calls the reception:
- Hello!
They answer him:
- Hello.
Husband:

The reception is responding:

Husband:
