A Frenchman, a German and a Georgian are asked:
- What is hanging below your waist?
The German says:
- Something that gives me pleasure.
The Frenchman says:
- Something that gives women pleasure.
The Georgian says:
- I have a dagger hanging below my belt, and what a Frenchman and a German have hanging, I always have!
