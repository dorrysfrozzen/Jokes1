The parents, finding their son masturbating, called a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist asks:
- Tell me, why are you doing this?
The son answers:
- Well, first of all, I get satisfaction, and secondly, I donate sperm to the sperm bank, for which I get money and $ 1000 comes out per month.
The psychiatrist clarifies:
- And the parents themselves, do they give you money?
Son:
- They don't give it. They are unemployed. Doctor, why were you called, what's wrong with me?
The psychiatrist says:
- Yes, it's all right with you! But your parents need to be treated!
