A woman comes to the doctor and complains:
- Doctor, help me! Transplant another penis to my husband. With this dick, he can only get me once a year.
The doctor answers:
- Send your husband to me, let's fix your grief.
The doctor sewed another penis on the man and a year later his wife is back at the doctor and complains again:
- Doctor, why are you doing this?
The doctor is at a loss:
- What exactly is wrong?
A woman in tears:
- Yes, my husband now can't even do it once a year and doesn't want to!
Doctor:
- Okay, I'll invite your husband to my office and examine what and how ...
the husband comes and thanks the doctor for changing his life:
- Thank you, Doctor! I take a secretary on the table a couple of times every morning, in the afternoon with two employees in turn, and in the evening with a friend's wife and on the way home I'll hook someone else for a light blowjob.
The doctor says:
- Can you leave at least a little for your wife?
Man:
- No, Doctor, I have a psychological barrier!
The Doctor spreads his hands:
- What kind of psychological barrier is that? How does it manifest itself?
The man answers:
- I can't even imagine fucking my wife with someone else's dick...
- Well, this is absolutely perverse!
