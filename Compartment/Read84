A black man worked in a construction crew. Once, after a day at work, he got drunk on vodka with the foreman, did not calculate his strength and passed out. The foreman hoisted him on his shoulder and dragged him to the exit. The watchman got caught at the meeting:
- Guys, I understand everything, we sat and drank... But why should the ruberoid be built?
