The wife calls her husband:
- Dorgoy, when you come back from work, buy chicken or cutlets. I'll be late as soon as I get there, I'll make a mashed potato.
The husband bought cutlets, came home, again a call from his wife:
- Well, what did you buy? Cutlets? I'm late, please fry them, I'll come and make a mashed potato.
The husband fried the cutlets, the bell rang:
- Fried it? Well, what a good fellow! I'm about to leave, peel the potatoes, I'll come cook.
The call will be made in 10 minutes:
- That's it, I'm out, put the potatoes to boil so as not to waste time.
The potatoes are cooked. The husband dials his wife, she does not let him insert a word:
- I'm already driving near the house! Did you cook the potatoes? Then add butter and milk, then remember everything, I'll be there in a couple of minutes.
They sat down to dinner, eating her mashed potatoes with cutlets. The husband thinks:
- Chet, there's a catch here...
