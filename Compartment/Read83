Two paratroopers are flying.
One to the other:
- Do you want an apple?
The second:
- Come on.
The first one gives the second paratrooper an apple. He eats it, the first one asks again:
- Do you want another one?
The second:
- Yes, come on.
The first one pulls another apple, the second one eats it again. Then he asks the first one:
- And where do you get the apples from?
The first:
- So you have a whole backpack of them on your back!
