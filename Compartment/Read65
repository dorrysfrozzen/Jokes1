There are three people sitting in a strip bar: a doctor, a lawyer and a banker. A naked stripper comes dancing to their table and starts twirling her ass in front of them. The doctor takes out ten dollars, slobbers it and puts it on the girl's ass. The lawyer took out $50 and stuck it on the other side. The banker took out a credit card, held it between the girl's buttocks and added:
- Paid for!
