Guys are standing on the street, drinking. One does not drink, his friends ask him:
- Are you tied up?
He answers:
- Yes, my wife said she would smell alcohol, she would not let me into the apartment.
Friends say:
- Come on... Have a good bite, kill the smell and that's it!
The guy drank. I had a bite of onion, bay leaf, smoked a couple of times, chewed half a pack of orbits. He comes home, calls the apartment. The wife is asking from behind the door:
- Have you been drinking again?
The guy answers:
- Not a gram. What makes you think that?
Wife:
"Breathe through the keyhole."
The guy breathed. The wife says:
- Hey, joker, stop joking! Breathe through your mouth!
