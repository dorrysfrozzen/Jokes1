A businessman is in a hurry for a meeting, is late, freaks out, can't park. He looks up at the sky and says:
- Jesus Christ, help me park. I will stop drinking, smoking, swearing, adultery, and I will go to church on weekends...
Suddenly, suddenly, as if on purpose, there is an empty parking space. The businessman looks to the sky again:
- Not everything, there's nothing to do, I've already found it!
