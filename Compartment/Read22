A Russian, an Englishman and an American found themselves on a desert island. They caught a goldfish. The fish, in return for the fact that they would let her go back to the sea, promised to do whatever they asked. They let the fish go and the American makes a wish:
- A glass of bourbon and go home to the ranch!
A moment. The American has a glass of bourbon in his hands, he drinks it and disappears from sight.
The Englishman makes a wish:
- 200 grams of gin and home to his native Liverpool.
A moment. The Englishman has a glass of gin in his hands, he drinks it and also disappears from sight.
The Russian thought, thought:
- It's not good somehow. We didn't sit, we didn't talk...
- A fish, a case of vodka and both back!
