A wolf, a fox and a boar fell into the pit. The fox looks at the boar and thinks:
- There's pork, we'll hold out for now, and then maybe we'll get out.
The wolf looked at the boar and the fox:
- There is something to eat, a woman who is not what she is, we live for now.
The boar looked at the fox and the wolf, sensed something was wrong and told them:
- Do you want me to sing to you?
They readily agreed. The boar screams with all his might. The hunters heard the screeching and ran to the pit and let's shoot at the fox and wolf with guns. The wolf is dying and bleeding and thinking:
- There was grub, there was a woman, but no, after all, give me a show.
