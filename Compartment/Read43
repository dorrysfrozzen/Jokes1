It's the middle of December. Employees are sitting at the post office sorting and sorting letters. I came across one open letter, a boy from an orphanage writes to Santa Claus:
- Hello Santa Claus! It's winter outside, and I don't have any warm clothes. Can you send me a hat, scarf and mittens for the New Year?
The workers at the post office felt this letter, no matter what Santa Claus would not send these gifts to the boy, and they decided to send things to the boy. They sent him a hat and a scarf. A week after the New Year, they come across a letter again from the same boy. The workers with a sense of pride decided to read how the boy thanks Santa Claus, opened the letter and read:
- Hello Santa Claus! Thank you so much for the gifts! But all I got from you was a hat and a scarf.
- And the mittens must have been saved at the post office...
