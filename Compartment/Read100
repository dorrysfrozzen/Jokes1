A guy comes to the bank to take out a loan and says:
- I have an amazing idea, I need a loan.
The manager asks him:
- What is your idea, enlighten me.
Guy:
- I need money to open a gay club.
Manager:
- Will your business at least pay off in order to return the money to the bank?
Man:
- Look at this... Who are all the traffic cops? pid@ry. They will definitely walk. Football referees, deputies... The neighbors are not traditional on my floor, these will definitely go with friends!
The manager was silent for a minute and says:
- I'm sorry, but we have to refuse you.
The husband says to him:
- Well, then you come!
