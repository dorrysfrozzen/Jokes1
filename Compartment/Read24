The colonel, who had served in the army all his life, decided to study another profession in retirement. I thought about it and decided to go to study to be a gynecologist. He has graduated and is taking the exam. The professor taking the exam asks the colonel:
- How do you imagine the external female genitalia?
Colonel:
- Professor, it's like a Mosin rifle!
The professor asks again:
- What do you mean?
Colonel:
– Longitudinal groove, transverse groove, pubis and hairline.
The professor is surprised:
- Yes, that's right.
- The second question is, how do you imagine the internal female genitalia?
The Colonel again:
- Professor, well, it's like a Mosin rifle!
Professor:
– How is it again?
COLONEL:
- Yes!
- Two lips, two pipes, suction and ejector.
Professor:
- An interesting approach, but true.
- You passed the exam.
- According to your concept, would you like to hear the answer to one more question?
COLONEL:
- Yes, Professor, as much as you like.
Professor:
– Can you get a woman into the right hole without making a mistake?
COLONEL:
– Professor, well, it's like Mosin's rifle again!
Professor:
- And in more detail?
- You put a woman on all fours in a corner, drip 1 drop of oil from the oil can onto the spine, accompany the drop with your right thumb until the second control click, then send it.
