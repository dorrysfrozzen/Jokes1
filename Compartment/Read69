A husband and wife are driving a car along the highway and passing a sign [Hit a skunk - prison!] They exchanged glances, smiled, and drove on. Suddenly, a skunk came out of nowhere and right under the car. We stopped, approached him, and suddenly a police car appeared on the horizon. The husband shouts to his wife:
- Hide it under your skirt soon!
The wife replied:
- But what about the smell?
Husband:
- Well, what are you like a little girl, pinch the skunk's nose, after all.
