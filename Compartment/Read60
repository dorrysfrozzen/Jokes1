A disgruntled man sends an SMS to his mother-in-law:
- Your product, does not cook food, does not clean the apartment, does not wash or iron!
Mother-in-law sends a reply sms:
- The choice was made consciously and by you personally! The product is sold, the warranty has expired, the manufacturer does not bear any responsibility!
P.S. The program may fail! Try to twist your key where it needs to be, if you can't do it yourself, hire a master!
