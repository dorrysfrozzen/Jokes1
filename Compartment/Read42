A married couple is driving a car on the highway. My husband is driving. The wife says:
- Dear, we have been married for almost 15 years and today I decided to tell you that I am divorcing you.
The husband remained silent and accelerated.
The wife continues:
- I'm sleeping with your best friend and he's cooler in bed than you are.
The husband again does not answer anything and increases the speed again.
The wife further argues:
- I'm taking our house and children from you, as well as all your money and car.
The husband silently patiently accelerated to 100 km / h and begins to direct the car to the support of the nearest bridge.
The wife is interested in her husband:
- You don't mind, dear?
The husband answers:
- I don't mind. I already have everything I need!
The wife asks again:
- And what do you have?
And a moment before the car hits the concrete support, the husband responds:
- The airbag!
