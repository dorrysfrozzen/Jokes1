A guy and a girl are riding in a compartment. Their gazes crossed by chance, a spark ran through them and they wanted each other. The girl, in order to stay on one, offers a kind of role-playing game:
- Give me a kind of faint, and you're like a doctor, you're going to pump me out.
The guy agreed. The girl kind of fainted, the guy said he was a doctor, asked to vacate the compartment. Everyone went out, and the guy and the girl started the treatment procedure. After sex, the guy goes out for a smoke break and tells the neighbors in the compartment:
- It's okay, everything's fine. I gave her an injection, she fell asleep.
One of the passengers:
- Handsome! Just fasten your fly, otherwise the syringe is sticking out!
