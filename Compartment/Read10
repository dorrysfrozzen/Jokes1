The plane has lost control and is falling. There is a panic in the cabin. The stewardess comes out and addresses the passengers:
- Dear passengers, I ask you not to panic! Now take out your passport and open them on the photo page.
The passengers calmed down a little, took out their passports and opened them on the page with the photo.
The stewardess continues:
- Now tear out the page with the photo and roll it into a tube.
Passengers tear out the page with the photo and roll it up into a tube.
The stewardess is next:
- Now everyone stuff this rolled-up page into your anus.
- Otherwise, in a disaster with corpses, such a mess!
