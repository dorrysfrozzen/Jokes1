A drunk man got on the bus, saw a woman sitting with a child and told her:
- Wow, you! Is that a chimpanzee or a macaque?
The woman indignantly:
- This is my child! Shame on you!
The woman couldn't stand it and burst into tears. The passengers raised a fuss about the man and a noisy scandal broke out. The bus stopped, the bus driver entered the cabin and threw the drunken instigator out into the street, approaches a woman with a child and says:
- Calm down, don't cry, everything is fine.
The woman says to the bus driver:
- Thank you for your help.
The driver responds:
- Oh, come on, these are small things. Here, take a banana for your monkey!
