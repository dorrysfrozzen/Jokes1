A crime boss brags about a new house in front of relatives. They enter the art gallery. The authority shows:
- Rostropovich drew this picture himself. And that one over there, bigger than Hvorostovsky himself. Spivakov did his best with this one.
One of the relatives asks in surprise:
- I did not understand. They're musicians!
The authority gently slaps the relative on the shoulder and says:
- When I say BRO DRAW, he draws!
