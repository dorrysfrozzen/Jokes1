A man buys an inflatable cheesecake for rolling down a slide. The seller put it on the counter, took out a pump and began to pump it, looking at the pressure gauge. A couple approaches and asks:
- Tell me, are baby strollers on sale?
The seller, without taking his eyes off the process, answers:
- No, come in three days...
the woman is slightly indignant:
- And what are you answering, but don't look me in the eye?
Seller:
- It's a shame that there are no strollers on sale.
