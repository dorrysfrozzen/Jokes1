A guy bought a lottery ticket, opens it and sees that he won a Mercedes S600, runs up to the seller in the booth to clarify, just in case, what the seller says:
- Congratulations on your winnings, tomorrow you need to drive up to the main office with your passport, arrange all the necessary papers to receive the winnings.
- By the way, if you don't need such a car, you can take the winnings in cash: $130,000.
A crazy man ran home to please his wife, and his wife was sitting all in tears and talking wistfully:
- Three hours ago, my mother died - your mother-in-law.
The man sat down on a stool and in a low voice:
- What the fuck happened!
