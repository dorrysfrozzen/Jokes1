An Odessan walks along Deribasovskaya Street, approaches a brothel and decides to enter it. I went in and saw two doors in the vestibule, on one a Blonde sign, on the other a Brunette.
Well, he goes to the blondes, there are two doors again. On one plate they are Fat, on the other they are Slender.
He went in where the fat ones are. There are two doors again. Beautiful and Not beautiful.
I went to the beautiful ones. Two doors again. Paid and Free.
The inhabitant of Odessa enters the door where they are free and goes out onto Deribasovskaya Street again.
