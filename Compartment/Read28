There is an exam in the medical institute. There is an opaque tank in the auditorium, which contains body parts. You need to put your hand in the tank, feel for the organ, tell everything about it, pull it out - if this is what they told you about, the exam is passed.
Several students have already passed the exam...
a student comes out to take the exam. She puts her hand in the tank and tells the commission:
- Sausage.
The rector is on the commission:
- Girl, don't be shy, call a spade a spade. You're a future doctor!
Student:
- That's what I call it! Sausage!
Rector:
"Are you sure?" Well, then get it out.
The student pulls her hand out of the tank and holds a stick of sausage in her hand.
The commission looks at each other, and the rector says:
- And what did we eat yesterday?
