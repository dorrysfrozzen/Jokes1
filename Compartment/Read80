A man came to the bar with his ten-year-old son and ordered a beer. He took a couple of sips, lit a cigarette, and his son asked him:
- Dad, can I have a beer and a cigarette?
Dad told him:
- Can you reach your nose with your end?
Son:
- Of course not.
Dad:
- Well, there is no trial. He's still young!
They got ready to go home, they leave the bar, and opposite there is a booth with different lotteries. My father bought a ticket, erased the protective cover, and there was nothing under it. Son:
- Dad, can I play the lottery?
Dad says:
- You can play the lottery, son.
My son bought one ticket, erased the protective layer, and under it a prize of 100,000 rubles!
Dad asks his son:
- Son, will you share the winnings with me?
The son answers:
- Dad, don't you reach your nose with your end?
Dad:
- Of course!
Son:
- Well, if you reach your nose with your end, suck it yourself!
