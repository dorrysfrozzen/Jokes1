Dear customer support.
Last year, I updated the programs on my computer. Instead of Buddy v.5.0, I installed Husband v.1.0 and noticed that the new program began to make changes to financial modules and limited access to applications like /flowers/ and /jeweler/, which worked fine when Buddy v.5.0 was installed.
In addition, Husband v.1.0 removed many other system applications and programs such as Romance v.9.9.3 and installed Soccer v.7.0 and Garage v. instead.4.5.2, as well as the TV version 6.0.
The Conversation v.8.0 application has an inactive shortcut and it no longer starts, and when you start the Home Cleaning program version 2.6.0, the entire system immediately freezes.
I tried to run Whining 5.3, but the system gives an error.
Please help me resolve the issue!
A desperate user.
