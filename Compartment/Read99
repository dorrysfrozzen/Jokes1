A man gets drunk, comes home drunk in a dugarin, opens the refrigerator and says:
- Chief, two counters! To the center! No? Fuck you!
I opened and closed half the night until I broke it. In the morning, I woke up earlier, took it and dragged it to the workshop until my wife saw it.
The wife woke up, there is no husband, no refrigerator and thought:
- He's stubborn, he left after all!
