Baba Yaga distilled moonshine, calls Kashchey and invites him to a glass:
- Come and try it first.
Kashchey:
- Yes, I have my hands full, I need to kidnap Vasilisa.
Yaga calls snake Garynych:
- Get in, let's roll.
The snake replied:
"I'm busy today, I need to burn down a couple of villages.
I called Leshy, who agreed. Yaga is sitting, waiting, looking out the window, and the Goblin is running, falling, getting up and running again. Yaga asks:
- And what is it that you fall all the way, then run again?
The Goblin answers:
- When I think that it's a free drink, my legs carry themselves. And when I think that I need to fuck you later, my legs immediately give way!
