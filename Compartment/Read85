A little girl watches her mom undress. Carefully examines the lower abdomen of the mother and asks:
- Mom, what's that between your legs?
The mother decided that it was time to explain to her daughter, gathered her thoughts and said:
"It's called a vagina. You have a vagina there.
My daughter thought about it and continued:
- Well, Grandma has a carriage there, then.
