Friends bought weed from a familiar distributor and went to the sauna. Smoked for the first time, does not insert. The hearts scored some more for a while, the smoke did not cover again. Let's go to the distributor to get the money back. They come and talk:
- Your grass is bad, it doesn't stick at all, give me the money.
The distributor says:
- Of course it's bad grass! That's what I thought right away when you came to me naked and with gangs!
