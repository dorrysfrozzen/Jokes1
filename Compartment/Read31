Before the exam, the student dropped the test card out of his hands out of excitement, and his friend, for fun, pushed it under the door to the classroom.
After a minute, the record flies back. They open it, it's GREAT there. The one who pushed the record takes out his own and also slips it into the crack under the door. After a minute, his credit card also flies out.
They open the second test, and it says
- I don't play the same game twice!
