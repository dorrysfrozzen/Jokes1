Three o'clock in the morning. Husband and wife are sleeping. The doorbell rings. The husband, swearing, goes to open it. There's a guy standing on the doorstep who's had a lot to drink:
- Friend, come with me, right next to me. Will you help me push?
Husband angrily:
- Are you a fucking man? Three o'clock in the morning. Go to hell.
The husband goes back to bed, the wife asks:
- Who came?
Husband:
- Yes, some guy got stuck, asked me to push him. I sent him to hell...
my wife is outraged:
- You're just some kind of monster. Do you remember how we stalled in the rain and some guy pushed us for almost an hour? Couldn't you help a man out?
The husband, swearing again, gets out of bed, gets dressed. He goes out into the yard in complete darkness and calls the man:
- Man! Where are you? Where are you?
There's a sound coming from the darkness:
- Yes, I'm here! Come here!
Husband:
- Yes, where is it here?
Guy:
- Yes, here, on the rocks!
